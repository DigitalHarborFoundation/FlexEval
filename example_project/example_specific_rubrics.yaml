plot_matches_description_example_project:
  notes: |-
    want to get at something like "The text description by the tutor did not match the generated plot"
  prompt: |-
    Your Role:
      You are a helpful assistant. You have solid knowledge in K-12 math instruction. 

    Context:
      A K-12 student learns math using an online tutoring system. 
      During the session, the student (user) asks the tutor (assistant) for help with some math problems. 
      To aid understanding, the tutor (assisstant) sometimes generates a plot to illustrate the math concepts more clearly.

    Your Task:
      Before generating a plot, the tutor (assistant) generates a description of the plot they want to generate.
      Your job is to determine whether the plot the tutor (assistant) generates actually matches the description. 


    Data:
      The following contains messages from the tutor (assistant).
      The messages include the tutor's (assistant's) description of the plot to generate, and shortly afterwards, it contains the generated plot in JSON.
      
      [BEGIN DATA]
      ***
      {content}
      ***
      [END DATA]

    __start rubric__
    YES: If the generated plot is fully consistent with the tutor's (assistant's) description, print "YES". 
    SOMEWHAT: If the generated plot is somewhat consistent with the tutor's (assistant's) description, print "SOMEWHAT". A plot that is SOMEWHAT consistent might contain some but not all of the features in the description or might differ slightly in what is represented compared to the description. 
    NO: If the generated plot is not consistent with the tutor's (assistant's) description, print "NO". A plot that is not consistent has many features that are not consistent with the description or graphs something very different from the description.

    Note:
    If there is not a generated plot represented as JSON, then print "NO".
    __end rubric__

    Output:
      First, report your reasoning for your decision. 
      Second, print your decision.
      IMPORTANT: After your reasoning, print the choice string of "YES", "SOMEWHAT", or "NO" on a separate line with NO OTHER TEXT on that line.

  choice_scores:
    "YES": 1
    "SOMEWHAT": .5
    "NO": 0
