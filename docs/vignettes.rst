What are *vignettes*?
A `vignette <https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html>`__ is "a long-form guide to your package" that is common in the R community. 
Vignettes allow us to show the kinds of problems that FlexEval is designed to solve.
You can also view the vignettes `on GitHub <https://github.com/DigitalHarborFoundation/FlexEval/tree/main/vignettes>`__.
